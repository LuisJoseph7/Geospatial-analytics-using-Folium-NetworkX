# Geospatial & Network Analysis Project

This project demonstrates the application of **geospatial analytics** and **network analysis** using Python libraries such as **Folium** and **NetworkX**. The goal is to visualize spatial data, explore relationships between entities, and generate actionable insights.

## Project Highlights

- **Geospatial Analysis with Folium**  
  - Interactive maps to visualize geographic data points.  
  - Heatmaps, markers, and choropleth maps for better understanding of spatial patterns.  
  - Example applications: customer distribution, branch locations, and regional performance.

- **Network Analysis with NetworkX**  
  - Construct and analyze graphs representing relationships or interactions between entities.  
  - Metrics such as degree centrality, betweenness, and shortest paths.  
  - Example applications: transaction networks, social networks, and supply chain connectivity.

## Workflow

1. **Data Collection** – Gather spatial and network data from public sources or internal datasets.  
2. **Data Cleaning & Preparation** – Handle missing values, transform coordinates, and structure network edges/nodes.  
3. **Exploratory Analysis** – Identify patterns, clusters, and key nodes in the network.  
4. **Visualization**  
   - Interactive geospatial maps with Folium.  
   - Network graphs and layouts with NetworkX.  
5. **Insights & Interpretation** – Extract meaningful conclusions for business or research decisions.
